File contents consist of a series of markers.
These markers express compressed file contents in-series.
Markers are byte aligned within the file.


Types:
* WORD: 16 bit word, big endian.
* WORD24: 24 bit word, big endian.


Markers:
* 0xE1, len:WORD24, data:BYTE[len-4]
** Compressed data block, contents use a Faux Zlib header.
** This is basically Zlib format, but with 9 for Deflate64, and A for BTLZH.
** (Drop) Each E1 block is encoded independently of the preceding blocks.
* 0xE3, len:WORD24, tag:TWOCC, data:BYTE[len-6]
** TWOCC Marker.
** TWOCC='ST' means stored data.
* 0xE4, len:WORD24, tag:FOURCC, data:BYTE[len-8]
** FOURCC Marker.
** FOURCC='BTLZ' means header.
*** flags:WORD
*** blockSize:BYTE; log2 of logical block size
*** windowSize:BYTE; log2 of window size.
*** if(flags&1)
**** name:ASCIIZ4; ASCII name padded to multiple of 4 bytes.
**** This is the name of the original file which was compressed.
* 0xEC, len:WORD40, data:BYTE[len-6]
** Compressed data block, contents use a Faux Zlib header.
** Basically like E1 but with a larger maximum block size.
* 0xED, len:WORD40, tag:TWOCC, data:BYTE[len-8]
** TWOCC Marker.
** TWOCC='ST' means stored data.

Possible:
* TWOCC='BI'
** Incremental Block
** With this block, the end of the prior block serves as a preset dictionary.
** (Change) This is now the default behavior.
** Consider independent blocks as the special case.
