Consider a VM for another small script language.
* Language will aim for low implementation complexity.
* May use a syntax along similar lines to ECMAScript.
** Though, with a fairly limited set of core features.

Major features:
* Dynamic Typing
* Likely dynamically scoped.
** Less code complexity in an interpreter than lexical scoping.
** Alternatively: Global/Local (like C) or "undefined".
** Maybe implemented as dynamic, but local vars don't match.
* List walking interpreter with no GOTO.
* Use dictionary objects for AST.
